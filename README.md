# End-to-End-Image-Classification
This project uses CIFAR10 dataset to implement end-to-end image classification project.

* You are going to deal with building Neural Networks Architectures based on the concept of the most popular nets.
*  
* Then hands on experience with hyperparameter tunning will be gained.
* 
* You are going to know how to implement custom loss function, so the recent published one called PolyLoss will be discussed.
